			<h3>What I've Done</h3>
			<p>Over the past few years I’ve interned as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.zocdoc.com/" target="_blank">ZocDoc</a>, co-founded a startup with one of the creators of turntable, built up <a href="http://www.princetoneclub.com/" target="_blank">the Princeton Entrepreneurship Club</a> to become one of the most influential student organizations on campus (with a few dozen officers, over 200 active members and 1,200 email subscribers), co-organized the first Startup Weekend at Princeton (<em>which has since inspired a <a>series of Princeton hackathons</a></em>), led Princeton’s annual <a href="http://www.princetoneclub.com/tigerlaunch/" target="_blank">startup challenge (<em>TigerLaunch</em>)</a> through its biggest year to date, served as curator for one of the first StartupDigest university issues, co-organized the first <a href="http://www.princetoneclub.com/hackweek/" target="_blank">“hack week” at Princeton</a> (<em>with over 75 students building apps over winter break</em>), and introduced three <a href="http://www.princetoneclub.com/programming-classes/" target="_blank">student-run programming classes</a> (<em>with a waitlist in the hundreds</em>) to the Princeton campus.</p>
			<h3>What I'm Doing Now</h3>
			<p>Nowadays, I spend a lot of my time building <a href="/portfolio">web and mobile apps</a>. Python has long been my language of choice, but recently its reign as my favorite has been challenged by Objective-C. Since beginning my exploration into the world of mobile apps, I have become particularly enamored by iOS development. I plan on publishing my first app to the App Store sometime this March or April.</p>
			<h3>What I Hope to Do Next</h3>
			<p>After graduating from Princeton in May, it is my goal to work at a startup in San Francisco or New York City. I plan to acquire more experience by joining a seasoned team that is deeply passionate about building high quality mobile products. Finally, it is my goal to one day take the plunge and start my own company - a dream I have had since a very young age!</p>
